# King-s-Hawaiian-Marketing-Project

King's Hawaiian is a family-owned business that for three generations has been dedicated to providing irresistible, original recipe Hawaiian foods made with Aloha Spirit. 

It makes the #1 branded dinner roll in the United States and the company operates baking facilities in Torrance, California, and Oakwood, Georgia.

The project identified which sales and marketing programs drive the most impact, thus allowing King's Hawaiian to optimize its marketing spend. The project has three goals:
- Determine the priority order of tactics
- Determine which marketing campaigns returned the most
- Identify what times throughout the year seem to have the highest ROI for Sales tactics and Marketing Activations

This project was completed by Yang Sun, Christopher PainTon, Zhechuan Jin, Jiayi Wang, Sue Xinxue Gu and me. Due to confidential issues, the original data files could not be uploaded.
