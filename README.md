# King-s-Hawaiian-Marketing-Project

King's Hawaiian is a family-owned business that for three generations has been dedicated to providing irresistible, original recipe Hawaiian foods made with Aloha Spirit. 

It makes the #1 branded dinner roll in the United States and the company operates baking facilities in Torrance, California, and Oakwood, Georgia.

The project will identify which sales and marketing programs drive the most impact, thus 
allowing King's Hawaiian to optimize its marketing spend. The project has three goals:
- determine the priority order of tactics
- determine which marketing campaigns returned the most
- identify what times throughout the year seem to have the highest ROI for Sales tactics 
and Marketing Activations
